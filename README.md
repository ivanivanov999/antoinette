## Antoinette Home Decor

This is my first attempt at creating an ecommerce platform for an existing family business.
The website is created using the MEAN stack + Google Firebase for image storage.

## Admin Panel

An admin panel was created for an easy new product upload and managing existing items, categories and orders.
Each item supports up to 4 images, with the first one being used as a thumbnail. Each image is being compressed using #sharp and uploaded to Google Firebase as a .webp file for storage and performance optimization purposes. The thumbnail gets further compressed to a smaller 300x300 size. Their secure Google Firebase urls then get stored in their respective item document in MongoDB.
